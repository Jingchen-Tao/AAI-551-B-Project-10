## üìå Project Overview

This project consists of a **graphical interface application** and a **model training script** developed in Python to predict **health insurance costs** based on user-provided personal information such as age, BMI, smoking status, etc.

The app is designed for **user-friendliness**, **modularity**, and **data transparency**, and includes advanced features like **real-time predictions**, **PDF export**, and **graphical visualizations**.

## üéØ Features

### ‚úÖ GUI Application (`gui_predictor.py`)

- Built with **Tkinter** and **TTK widgets** for modern styling
- Soft yellow themed background and professional layout
- Input fields:
  - Age
  - BMI
  - Number of Children
  - Sex (male/female)
  - Smoker (yes/no)
  - Region (northeast/northwest/southeast/southwest)
- Predict button to calculate insurance cost using a **trained regression model**
- **Popup output** with predicted result
- **CSV logging**: Automatically stores all prediction records in `user_predictions.csv`
- **"Last Prediction"** shows the latest predicted data from CSV
- **"Show Chart"** visualizes historical prediction trends with Matplotlib
- **"Save as PDF"** feature to export the most recent prediction with a user-chosen filename
- **"Open CSV"** to launch the full prediction history file
- **"Clear"** and **"Exit"** controls
- **Logo support** (`logo.png`) for branded appearance

### ‚úÖ Model Training Script (`train_model.py` or similar)

- Reads and processes data from `insurance.csv`
- Handles:
  - One-hot encoding of categorical variables (sex, smoker, region)
  - Splits into features and target labels (`charges`)
- Trains a **Linear Regression model**
- Outputs:
  - **R¬≤ Score**
  - **Mean Squared Error (MSE)**
- Saves the trained model as `insurance_model.pkl` using `joblib`
- Designed for reuse in GUI-based prediction apps
